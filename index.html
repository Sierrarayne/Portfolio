A design student, I originally was going to major in Apparel Textiles and Merchandise, then I realized making the posters for the class were more interesting than sewing the clothes. My grammy calls me Hurricane Sierra because anywhere I sit to work my space becomes cluttered and messy in seconds. I have always been that way but that’s what is comfortable, a mess is proof of creativity at work to me. The chaotic clutter on my desk is something I can control and make something with vs. the chaotic clutter in my mind searching for a place to go. </p>

            <p>Here is what I’ve learned in my web 1 class...
                I have learned how to code, how to make a website, how to design said website. I learned how to make an animation through code, how to make things colorful, or only colorful if clicked on or hovered over. I have learned how to ask questions in coding. I have learned that coding is for those with patience and ability to look at the smallest detail to fix a mistake. I have learned I really like making mood boards and style tiles on figma. I have learned that chat gpt is not my enemy but a friend when it comes to coding, a best friend even. But most importantly, the biggest lesson I have learned is that coding, coding is not for me. I am not a one to build responsive sites, and create code that millions will use. However, while I have found what I am not going to pursue, I also discovered my love for creating a direction for a project to go, creating the style or mood for a project to be built apon.  </p>

A design student, I originally was going to major in Apparel Textiles and Merchandise, then I realized making the posters for the class were more interesting than sewing the clothes. My grammy calls me Hurricane Sierra because anywhere I sit to work my space becomes cluttered and messy in seconds. I have always been that way but thatâ€™s what is comfortable, a mess is proof of creativity at work to me. The chaotic clutter on my desk is something I can control and make something with vs. the chaotic clutter in my mind searching for a place to go. </p>

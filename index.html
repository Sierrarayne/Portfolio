A design student, I originally was going to major in Apparel Textiles and Merchandise, then I realized making the posters for the class were more interesting than sewing the clothes. My grammy calls me Hurricane Sierra because anywhere I sit to work my space becomes cluttered and messy in seconds. I have always been that way but that’s what is comfortable, a mess is proof of creativity at work to me. The chaotic clutter on my desk is something I can control and make something with vs. the chaotic clutter in my mind searching for a place to go. </p>

            <h1>Here is what I’ve learned in my web 1 class...</h1>
              <p>I have learned how to code, how to make a website, how to design said website. I learned how to make an animation through code, how to make things colorful, or only colorful if clicked on or hovered over. I have learned how to ask questions in coding. I have learned that coding is for those with patience and ability to look at the smallest detail to fix a mistake. I have learned I really like making mood boards and style tiles on figma. I have learned that chat gpt is not my enemy but a friend when it comes to coding, a best friend even. But most importantly, the biggest lesson I have learned is that coding, coding is not for me. I am not a one to build responsive sites, and create code that millions will use. However, while I have found what I am not going to pursue, I also discovered my love for creating a direction for a project to go, creating the style or mood for a project to be built apon.  </p>

            <h1>What is design to me?</h1>
                <p>The longer I am in this major, the more classes I go to and people I meet I find a love for the earlier steps of design. I fall in love with the sketches, the drafts, the ideas, the debate on what colors or text fit the demographic of audience we are trying to reach. Searching for meaning in every choice we make, it is poetic and I find it truly amazing seeing how far a design can go from the simple pencil marks on a page to a digital art form. </p>
